# UAV Technology for Avalanche Search and Rescue

This project presents a custom-built UAV system designed to assist in avalanche rescue operations. The drone utilizes a GPS beacon detection system to locate and mark avalanche victims with high visibility powder, helping reduce search time and increase survival rates.

## Features
- Arduino-based GPS beacon and receiver communication
- Real-time drone positioning and victim localization
- Powder marking system for rapid victim identification
- FPV control system with pilot and co-pilot cameras
- Designed for harsh environments (e.g., sub-zero temperatures)

## Technologies
- Arduino Nano, LoRa Transceivers, Neo-6M GPS
- Tekko32 ESC, ETHIX Motors, Matek PDB
- MAVLink-OSD, BetaFlight, Caddx Micro F2 camera
- 3D printed housing and custom frame build
